        // ***** Plan: Historical and RT quote data
        // - the Website.app, once a day, gets historical price data from YF. Get all history.
        // - for RT price: during market-hours use IEX 'top', because it is free (and YF might ban our IP if we query too many times, IB has rate limit per minute, and VBroker need that bandwidth)
        // - pre/postmarket, also use YF, but with very-very low frequency. Once per every 5 sec. (only if any user is connected). We don't need to use IB Markprice, because YF pre-market is very quickly available at 9:00, 5.5h before open.
        // - code should know whether it is pre/postmarket hours, so we have to implement the same logic as in VBroker. (with the holiday days, and DB).
        // - Call AfterMarket = PostMarket, because shorter and tradingview.com also calls "post-market" (YF calls: After hours)

        // ***************************************************
        // YF, IB, IEX preMarket, postMarket behaviour
        // >UTC-7:50: YF:  no pre-market price. IB: there is no ask-bid, but there is an indicative value somehow, because Dashboard bar shows QQQ: 216.13 (+0.25%). I checked, that is the 'Mark price'. IB estimates that (probably for pre-market margin calls). YF and others will never have that, because it is sophisticated.
        // >UTC-8:50: YF:  no pre-market price. IB: there is no ask-bid, but previously good indicative value went back to PreviousClose, so ChgPct = 0%, so in PreMarket that far away from Open, this MarkPrice is not very useful. IB did reset the price, because preparing for pre-market open in 10min.
        // >UTC-9:10: YF (started at 9:00, there is premarket price: "Pre-Market: 4:03AM EST"), IB: There is Ask-bid spread. This is 5.5h before market open. That should be enough. So, I don't need IB indicative MarkPrice. IB AccInfo website is also good, showing QQQ change. IEX: IEX shows some false data, which is not yesterday close, but probably last day postMarket lastPrice sometime, which is not useful. So, in pre-market this IEX 'top' cannot be used. But maybe IEX cloud can be used in pre-market. Investigate.
        // It is important here, because of summer/winter time zones that IB/YF all are relative to ET time zone 4:00AM EST. This is usually 9:00 in London, 
        // but in 2020-03-12, when USA set summer time zone 2 weeks early, the 4:00AM cutoff time was 8:00AM in London. And IB/YF measured itself to EST time, not UTC time. Implement this behaviour.
        // >UTC-0:50: (at night).
