    //https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/  free, under MIT licence, and it is the engine under StackOverflow (very high performance needs), so it is fast. Use that.
    //https://github.com/thepirat000/CachingFramework.Redis built on  StackExchange.Redis, extra features: tagging, serialization on a cluster of Redis servers (not needed now)

    // Unlike Sql, ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect() is not caching connections, but rebuilt it again every time which takes 90ms. We have to handle connection caching.
    // Because Connect takes 80ms, in an app, we have to keep it somewhere globally, so we don't Connect to Redis every time.
    // In a big App, we can keep a couple of this connections open if we want. That maybe good, because it can be latency bound, so better to keep more connections open.
