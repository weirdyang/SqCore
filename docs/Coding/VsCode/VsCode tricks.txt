- start vscode in any directory in CMD, type: "code ."  // runs code with the current directory.

Shortcuts:
Debugger:
- F5: Debug, attach debugger
- Ctrl-F5: Run without attaching debugger

Code editing:
- F12: Go to definition
- Go to definition via mouse: hold down Control, Move mouse over a method, simple click (not double click). After that Ctrl-Back will go back.
- Alt-LeftArrow, Alt-RightArrow: Navigate back and forward. (after Go To Definition, or after changing opened files.). Navigate Forward only makes sense After a Navigate Back, otherwise nothing happens.
- F2: Refactoring:Rename symbol (function, variable) in all files. see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring
- Ctrl-K, Ctrl-F Format selection.

- Ctrl+Shift+O (Go to Symbol, in editor window). type : for lines, @ for symbols. (no local symbols, only class symbols in C#, in TS it works for local symbols too) Can save a lot of navigation time.
- Ctrl+T (Go to Symbol, in workspace) (jumping to a symbol across files)

Vscode services:
- (Ctrl + ,): Search Settings
- (Ctrl + ') toggles the Terminal window parts
- (Ctrl+Shift+B) start build
- Ctrl+P (Quick Open 'file') + and start to type any filename: "*.ts", or "Program.cs". It is easier to find files than browsing. You can now continue to navigate to the symbols of a file result simply by typing '@'.



- 2019-09-20: I found no way to run task (tasks.json) in an external terminal (only internal),
however, it is possible to launch things in launch.json and use "externalConsole": true

- open tab in new window
// There is no floating window concept in vscode, probably because of Linux
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43362133/visual-studio-code-open-tab-in-new-window
"When I want to split the screens I usually do one of the following:
1. open new window (new vscode instance) with: Ctrl+Shift+N and after that I drag the current file I want to the new window.
on dual display, it is better (the second vscode instance is on a different screen)
2. on the File explorer - I hit Ctrl+Enter on the file I want - and then this file and the other file open together 
in the same screen but in split mode, so you can see the two files together. If the screen is wide enough this is not a bad solution at all that you can get used to.
(if the screen is huge, 40", then this is better if vsCode is extended to fullscreen. Less mouse and eye movement.)
