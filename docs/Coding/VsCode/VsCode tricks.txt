- open tab in new window
// There is no floating window concept in vscode, probably because of Linux
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43362133/visual-studio-code-open-tab-in-new-window
"When I want to split the screens I usually do one of the following:
1. open new window (new vscode instance) with: Ctrl+Shift+N and after that I drag the current file I want to the new window.
on dual display, it is better (the second vscode instance is on a different screen)
2. on the File explorer - I hit Ctrl+Enter on the file I want - and then this file and the other file open together 
in the same screen but in split mode, so you can see the two files together. If the screen is wide enough this is not a bad solution at all that you can get used to.
(if the screen is huge, 40", then this is better if vsCode is extended to fullscreen. Less mouse and eye movement.)
