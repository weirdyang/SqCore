2. Naming conventions 
Using underscores (_) is not forbidden, but please avoid it. It cannot be used in class name and method name. It can be used as a part of the prefixes g_, m_, p_.
    • 2.1. Class names should start with an uppercase letter.  (CWindow, Vector)
    • 2.2. Global variable names: start with a g_   prefix					// flavour of 'Hungarian notation'
    • 2.3 Member variable names: start with  m_ prefix (recommended only)	// 2020: it is still used in corefx/src/System.Collections/src/System/Collections/BitArray.cs
    // ignore this. • 2.4. Parameter name: start with  p_ prefix			// 2020: it is not used by IDEs and auto-complete, so difficult to maintain this. Don't use that. Only m_, g_
    • 2.5. Local variable names:  start with a lowercase letter
    • 2.6. Constants (const, enum) : start with an uppercase letter
    • 2.7. Function names: every new word starts with an uppercase letter(SetPort())
    • 2.9. The language of variables, methods, comments, etc. is English.
	
	
	
	
3. Curly Braces.
This is the standard in DotNet core. Follow this.

if(myBoolean == true)
{
    //do something
}
else
{
    //do something else
}
	
	
4.
Try to use C# 8 declarative 'switch expressions', instead of procedural 'switch statements'.
Shorter, less chance of making mistakes.
