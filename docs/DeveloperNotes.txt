********************** SqCore framework on Github Folder structure

SqCore: 
/3rdParty
/logs  (do not commit to GitHub)
/docs
/src is this
	/ThirdParty
		/IB TWS 
	/Common
		/SqCommon	(all programs, small tools)
		/DbCommon	(programs that need database)
		/WebAppCommon	(not small tools, but bigger webbapps that handle HTTP requests)
		/DesktopUICommon (in case we write an app which has destkop UI, like SqDesktop for Windows)
	/Matlab		(things that are not C#)
	/R
	/Python	(tools, apps, written in Python)
	/Server	 (examples)
		/HealthMonitor(Server)
		/Overmind
		/Crawlers
			/XYCrawler
		/VirtualBroker
	/WebServer  (all is Website based)
		/SqCoreWeb (main website that contains MarketDashboard)
		/HealthMonitorClientFrontEndWebsite (because this should be in another serverFarm than the othe)
		/UserHelperWebsite (CurrentLeverageCalculator + OvermindClient+VBrokerClient+all other Clients)
	/Tools  (not really resident, always running server apps, only small exe tools needed for something)
/test	Tools for testing small things (HttpConnection, Rx, EmailSending), like HelloWorld
	UnitTests  (all unit tests in one csproj)
	PerformanceTests  (all benchmark tests in one csproj)
	PerformanceTestExperiment (customizable to benchmark only 2 versions of a single function)



************ each website (SqCore) has a folder structure like this:
1.
https://www.sqcore.net will have a list of tools. like now on https://www.snifferquant.net/. (with login/logout)
(The idea that www.sqcore.net returns NULL, and the main functionality is on www.sqcore.net/DAC is good for security, but annoying for the user,
and it is not the industry practice. We have to attack unwanted traffic in other ways: SqFirewall, logging, blacklist IPs who query frequently, etc.)
2. static HTML pages with Controllers (MVC) who serve them.
https://www.sqcore.net/VXXAdaptiveConnorLiveBacktest  	(served from static HTMLs in the secret_wwwroot folder. can connect to /Controllers folder.)			
3. Angular SPA projects:
MarketDashboard (https://www.sqcore.net/MarketDashboard the main InfoPusher) (folder /angular/MarketDashboard)  (uses /angular/angularLib)
QuickTester (https://www.sqcore.net/QuickTester), 							(folder /angular/QuickTester)
HealthMonitor (https://www.sqcore.net/HealthMonitor), 						

It is not necessary, but later, on the user side, we can do subdomains like that:
https://Dashboard.sqcore.net   it is just a synthetic sugar to https://www.sqcore.net/Dashboard
https://HealthMonitor.sqcore.net
https://QuickTester.sqcore.net
(this is how to do it https://timdows.com/projects/host-multiple-spas-with-aps-net-core/)


Target folder structure:
/Angular
	/MarketDashboard
	/HealthMonitor
	/QuickTester
	/AngularCommon
/Pages  (MVR views and Razor pages)
	Error.cshtml
/Controllers 



************ Webserver: Source code separation of many webapps (tools). There are two options:
Option1: 
https://sqcore.net/ContangoVisualizer.html (then all files of all Tools is in the wwwroot/js/ts/css folders.  However, it seems messy and less separation.
Option2:
https://sqcore.net/ContangoVisualizer/ (index.html) is taken. So, preferable we have all JS/TS/CSS/images in that folder.
Choose option2.
So, in the wwwroot/css/js/ts/images folder there should be the only files that are used by many WebApps. But the specific TS/CSS files should be in their own folder.
